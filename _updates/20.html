<h2>
	Update 20
</h2>
<h3>
	January 26, 2015
</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Added support for default emergency vehicles (meaning basic emergency vehicles will have emergency lighting without needing to download another addon)</li>
	<li>Vehicles spawned without a VehicleTable will have their default Photon specification applied. This means all car dealer NPCs and vehicle spawn systems will work by default, however there will still be some limited flexibility (such as the inability to use custom cars unless you enable VehicleTable pinning).</li>
	<li>Added default Police Chevy Impala (spawn from LW Emergency Vehicles tab)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Added turn signal support to remaining core vehicles</li>
</ul>
