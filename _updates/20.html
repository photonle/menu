legacy: false
date: January 26, 2015
changes:
  - type: new
    change: Added support for default emergency vehicles (supported vehicles have emergency lighting without downloading another addon)
  - type: new
    change: Vehicles spawned without a VehicleTable have their default Photon specs applied. This means all car dealer NPCs and vehicle spawn systems will work by default, however there will still be some limited flexibility (such as the inability to use custom cars unless you enable VehicleTable pinning).
library:
  - Added default Police Chevy Impala (LW Emergency)
  - Added turn signals to other default vehicles
